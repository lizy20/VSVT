function cam = makeOrthoCamP( scale, roll, pitch, yaw, camLoc )
  % cam = makeOrthoCamP( scale, roll, pitch, yaw, camLoc )
  %
  % Inputs:
  % scale - a scalar describing the scaling of space onto the image plane
  % roll - a positive rotation about the z axis
  % pitch - a positive rotation about the x axis
  % yaw - a positive rotation about the y axis
  % camLoc - a three element vector describing the location of the camera
  %   center (x,y,z).
